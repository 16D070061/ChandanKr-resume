## First Quantum of Contribution

Hello All,

I am back to my very own space. I was hoping to write on to this page since a very long time. But yeah, if only I could have contributed earlier. But better late than never.

Choosing an organisation is a difficult task in its own. It’s like choosing a dish at a restaurent you visited for the first time with all dishes unfamilier. Choosing interest over programming language you know is like choosing taste over money.

After looking for various restaurents in the street, and after going through their menu and prices, finally settled with a restaurent named Scikit-learn, which offered taste of my interest and the money I could afford.

So, after staring at the menu for a long enough time, I decided to put my money on this. The cheapest I could find!! ;)

And yeah, the food was great, also the price. Will be sticking around here for a while at least.

Let’s dive deeper into the food I had, ohh, the issue I solved.
